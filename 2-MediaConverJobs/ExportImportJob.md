# Exporting and Importing AWS Elemental MediaConvert Jobs

Completed MediaConvert jobs remain on the Jobs page for three months. If you want to be able to run a new job based on a completed job more than three months after you run it, export the job after it has completed and save it. 

Depending on how many jobs you've already ran, exporting and then importing a job can be simpler than finding a particular job in your list and duplicating it.

There are a few other reasons you might want to export a completed job. You want to:
* Run the same job in a different region it was originally ran in
* Run the same job in a different account 
* Use the exported JSON as a starting point for automating job creation

## Prerequisites

## Export a Completed Job
